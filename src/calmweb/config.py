# anything -- it freezes certificate validation. Outlook stops at "loading
# profile" while CryptoAPI retries a CRL it will never receive.
#
# The certificate authorities are also named in the whitelist; this is the
# layer that covers the ones no list knows about. It has no switch in the

#
# An account that cannot elevate in place is never asked in the first place:
# CalmWeb reads the elevation type off its own token, and only an
# administrator running with a filtered token gets the prompt (see
