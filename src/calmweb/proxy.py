"""HTTP/HTTPS proxy handler with blocklist enforcement.

Protocol notes
--------------
* **HTTP/1.1** requests reach the handler in absolute form and are filtered,
  rewritten and forwarded.
* **HTTP/2** is negotiated with ALPN *inside* the TLS session, so it rides
  through the ``CONNECT`` tunnel untouched.  The tunnel is a byte relay and
  must therefore never assume request/response framing, and must tolerate
  long idle periods -- an h2 connection is deliberately kept open and idle
  between requests.
* **HTTP/3 / QUIC** cannot be carried by an HTTP/1.1 ``CONNECT`` proxy.
  Every mainstream browser detects the configured system proxy and falls
  back to HTTP/2 over TCP on its own, which is filtered normally.  No
  firewall rule is needed to force that: earlier versions blocked outbound
  UDP/443 machine-wide, which enforced a fallback that already happens and
  penalised every other application on the machine.
* **WebSockets** over plain HTTP use an ``Upgrade`` handshake; the upgrade
  headers are preserved and the connection becomes a raw relay.

    and serving them over HTTPS would need a certificate whose own revocation
    status could not be checked without recursing.  RFC 5280 §4.2.1.13 and
    RFC 6960 §A.1 both assume cleartext.

    Catching them with the "HTTPS only" rule protects nothing and breaks
    certificate validation instead: the client receives an HTML error page
    where it expected DER, and retries until it gives up.  Outlook shows this
    as an indefinite "loading profile", because the chain validation it does
    on the first connection to Exchange never completes.  It then looks fixed
    for days once the proxy is turned off long enough for one successful
    fetch, since Windows caches a CRL for its whole validity period.

    The certificate authorities are named in the whitelist, which handles the
    ones we know about.  This is the second layer, for the ones we do not: an
    enterprise CA on an intranet, a regional authority, a CRL that moved to a
    new hostname.  Missing one is not a loud failure -- validation simply
    stalls, with nothing in the logs to point at -- which is why the shape of
    the request is worth trusting on its own.
